          Orlando
        </h3>

        <p class="text-tiny sm:text-base mb-1 text-justify">
          A visit to Orlando is a classic choice with it being home to world renowned theme parks like Walt Disney World and Universal Orlando. This bustling city is always reinventing itself so that no two visits to the entertainment mecca are alike. Outside of the theme parks, it is an easy drive to visit the Kennedy Space Center or take a daytrip to Cocoa Beach. With numerous attractions like extraordinarily themed mini golf courses and dinner shows with animals and acrobatics, you could visit Orlando and never step one foot in a theme park!

          Las Vegas
        </h3>

        <p class="text-tiny sm:text-base mb-1 text-justify">
          Las Vegas is a destination that needs no introduction but is often an overlooked option for a summer vacation. Whether you are planning a girl’s weekend, bachelor party, an adult-only retreat, or a family vacation, Las Vegas is a solid choice as it really does have something for everyone. Casinos are prevalent, but there are countless restaurants and stores along the famed Last Vegas Strip, in addition to activities for the whole family like escape rooms, indoor skydiving and the High Roller observation wheel. Adults will enjoy the nightlife with live music and dancing as well as a seemingly endless options of entertaining shows like Cirque du Soleil and standup comedians.

        <p class="text-tiny sm:text-base mb-1 text-justify">
          Pro Tip: When considering a vacation to Las Vegas, be sure to think outside the oasis of the “Strip”. It is easy to rent a car from various locations so that you can hit the pavement and explore outside the city limits. An adventurous spirit will be rewarded when seeing the Grand Canyon for the first time, an impressive view that can then be compared to that of the Hoover Dam, another location within a short drive of Las Vegas.
