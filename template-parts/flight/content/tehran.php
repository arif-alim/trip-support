    This airport is the central hub of Iran’s capital city. Located roughly 30 kilometers southwest of Tehran, this is the go-to airport when traveling to Tehran. Tehran International Airport is one of only two international airports in the city and is also the biggest. Despite its size, it’s only the third busiest airport in Iran meaning there’s ample space for passengers to move about the facility. Tehran International Airport is also home to over 40 shops and services including but not limited to a chocolate shop, cafe, cigarette shop, watch shop, and jewelry shop.
